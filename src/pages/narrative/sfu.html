        <div class="narrative-dated-body">
          <p>Before coming to Canada, and later during my first year at Fraser International College, I was not very strong at programming. I had learned the basics of Python and C, but only to pass classes. I had never built real projects or understood how programming could fit into a future career.</p>

        <div class="narrative-dated-body">
          <p>After transferring to SFU, even during my first semester there, I completed assignments without really seeing the bigger picture. I was focused on finishing tasks rather than understanding how they connected to real-world software or engineering roles.</p>
          <p>During that period, I also started working as a Data Analyst at Synkron. That role gave me valuable experience working with structured data and real business problems. Through my work at Synkron, I was also exposed to machine learning systems in practice. However, I interacted with them only as input–output tools. Data went in, predictions came out. I didn’t know how models were trained, how they were tuned, or how they were built from scratch. It was a data-focused role, not a software or machine learning engineering one.</p>

        <span class="narrative-dated-label">Summer 2025 and After</span>
        <div class="narrative-dated-body">
          <p>Everything started to change in the summer of 2025, when I took Introduction to Software Engineering course at SFU. That was the first time I worked on a real project from start to finish. Around that period, I also started meeting more people through workshops and student communities, and I became very aware of how far behind I felt — many people already had strong programming backgrounds, large projects, or internship experience.</p>
          <p>There was a moment of real self-doubt. But instead of trying to compete with others, I realized I needed to focus on becoming better compared to who I was before. That shift in mindset marked the beginning of a much more intentional and disciplined approach to learning.</p>
          <p>SFU marked the point where my interest in technology became structured and intentional. What started as curiosity quickly turned into building, breaking, and refining real systems — from software engineering workflows to data-driven projects and machine learning pipelines. This stage is about learning how things work under the hood and applying that knowledge in practical, collaborative settings.</p>

        <h2>Focus at SFU</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Computer Science foundations</strong><br>Systems, databases, software engineering, and probability — learning how software actually runs, scales, and fails.</li>
          <li><strong>Building real projects</strong><br>Frontend apps, ML pipelines, and team-based projects where ideas turn into working systems.</li>
          <li><strong>Direction toward ML / AI</strong><br>Applying math, statistics, and programming to data-driven decision making.</li>

      <section class="narrative-section">
        <h2>Milestones</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>First full software engineering workflow</strong><br>Working with Git branches, issues, pull requests, and structured planning in a team environment.</li>
          <li><strong>First end-to-end ML pipeline</strong><br>From exploratory data analysis to model training, evaluation, and iteration.</li>
          <li><strong>Frontend + API integration</strong><br>Building interfaces that connect user input to real logic and data processing.</li>
          <li><strong>Hackathons & applied projects</strong><br>Fast-paced problem solving under constraints, similar to real-world engineering scenarios.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="narrative-section">
        <p>This stage isn’t about mastery yet — it’s about building strong foundations, learning how to learn, and developing habits that scale as projects become more complex.</p>
