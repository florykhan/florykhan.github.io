        <div class="narrative-dated-body">
          <p>When I started working as a Data Analyst at Synkron, it was my first time contributing to real business problems in a professional environment.</p>
          <p>My role focused on working with structured datasets related to demand-driven supply chain systems.</p>
          <p>I supported analysis around trends, variability, and data quality, and used statistical methods to help with forecasting and planning use cases.</p>
          <p>At that stage, my work was primarily data-focused.</p>
          <p>I interacted with existing machine learning models as tools rather than systems I fully understood.</p>
          <p>Data went in, predictions came out.</p>
          <p>I could evaluate outputs, compare metrics, and communicate results to stakeholders, but I didn’t yet understand how models were built, trained, or tuned.</p>
          <p>This experience still mattered a lot.</p>
          <p>It showed me how messy real-world data is, how constraints shape technical decisions, and how analytics fits into business workflows.</p>
          <p>I learned how to structure problems, communicate insights clearly, and think about impact beyond just code or models.</p>
          <div class="narrative-dated-emphasis narrative-dated-emphasis-purple">
            <p>Synkron became a bridge between theory and practice for me.</p>
            <p>It helped me realize that building AI systems is not just about models, but about data pipelines, evaluation, communication, and making decisions in imperfect conditions.</p>
          </div>
          <p>That realization pushed me to move beyond using machine learning as a black box and start learning how these systems actually work — which later shaped how I approached my own software and ML projects.</p>
